Collaboration policy
We follow the Stanford Honor Code and the CS Department Honor Code – read them!
● Rule 1: Don’t look at solutions or code that are not your own; everything you
submit should be your own work
● Rule 2: Don’t share your solution code with others; however discussing ideas or
general strategies is fine and encouraged
● Rule 3: Indicate in your submissions anyone you worked with
● Rule 4: Do not submit AI-generated responses
Turning in something late/incomplete is better than violating the honor code

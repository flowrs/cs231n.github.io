Project Expectations
- Fairly open-ended, anything related to vision. Must include visual data.
- Potential Project Ideas
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kcf8S1UVPo4TAcoJvn9d6uj_wl2Ah9wj/edit
- Completed in groups of 1-3 people
- Project expectations are higher for groups with more people
- Two Types of Projects
- Applications: apply vision techniques to your particular domain or interest (e.g. medicine,
physics, etc.)
- Models: build a new model (algorithm) and apply it to tackle vision tasks. This track might
be more challenging, and could lead to a piece of publishable work

Project Expectations
The final report has the following structure:
● Title, Author(s)
● Abstract
● Related Work
● Methods
● Data Description
● Experiments and Results
● Conclusion
● Supplementary Material (optional)

Project Expectations
Does my project meet expectations?
- Rule of thumb: how much effort are you putting into your project?
- Strong projects might…
- Propose a novel variant of a technique (which takes a lot of effort)
- Adapts an existing technique to a totally new problem (which takes a lot of effort)
- Weaker projects might…
- Spend several weeks collecting/cleaning data rather than testing hypotheses
- Clone an existing repo and do minimal stitching to make it work for a Kaggle
competition

Project Expectations
This does not mean:
- Your project has to be strictly novel to get a good grade (although, we encourage this!)
- You have to beat the state-of-the-art performance to get a good grade (you donʼt have
to come up with the next best object detector to test an interesting hypothesis)
This does mean:
- You need to put a significant effort into your investigation, and you may have to try
many different approaches
- In your analysis, ask yourself:
- Are you interpreting and understanding your results, or merely stating them?
- Are you just plotting a loss curve, or are you evaluating the results of your approach from
many different angles?

Picking a Project Idea
Consideration of Interests
- Do what is important or interesting to you, not what seems easiest.
- You will be far more motivated if youʼre invested in what youʼre doing
- What do you really care about? Healthcare? Sports? Ethics? You can probably find
its intersection with computer vision
Practical Considerations
1. Data: Is there existing data for this problem? Will I need to spend weeks collecting it
myself?
2. Code & framework: Will I have to implement this myself, or is there an existing
implementation.

Picking a Project Idea: Sources of Inspiration
Conferences:
- CVPR: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
- ICCV: International Conference on Computer Vision
- ECCV: European Conference on Computer Vision
- NeurIPS: Neural Information Processing Systems
- ICLR: International Conference on Learning Representations
- ICML: International Conference on Machine Learning
Note: Do not even begin to try to read through all of these papers, or even their titles.
There are far too many. Use CMD+F to find papers with relevant keywords.

Picking a Project Idea: Reading Papers
How to read papers efficiently
- Do not read a paper linearly on your first pass
- First, read the abstract (word for word) as well as the figures & captions
- Does the paper still seem relevant? If so, read the methods as well as the results
- Finally, read the entire paper linearly (if the additional detail seems useful)
Papers are not always the most efficient way to digest an idea. Also try looking for:
- Talks, videos, or blog posts on the topics
- Github repos, containing actual code for the idea

Questions?
Q: Can I change my project after the proposal, before the milestone?
A: Yes, the proposal is to make sure you have a plausible project direction. If you need to
change project directions, we understand. Just check with a CA in OH.
Q: Can I change my project after the milestone?
A: In general, we do not encourage this. At this point in the course, there will be little time
to put together a sufficient project.
Q: How many cloud compute credits will I get?
A: Each student will receive 50 USD in GCP credits.
